## About
The name *Nine* pays homage to the nine established Chinatowns within New York City. This app has been my passion project for the past few years. After witnessing firsthand the profound impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Asian-owned businesses in the city, I felt compelled to create the app to uplift and amplify their presence. Nine currently acts as a curated guide to some of NYC's most beloved, Asian-owned institutions, offering a culturally diverse selection accompanied by in-depth descriptions and contact information for each business. While the current list is by no means exhaustive, we actively encourage users to contribute their own recommendations, ensuring a continuously expanding and inclusive platform for all.
