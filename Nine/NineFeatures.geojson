This Japanese-owned store is truly one of DUMBO's hidden neighborhood gems, offering a curated selection of vintage clothings and beautifully crafted home goods that celebrate the beauty found in objects from around the world.\n\nAs you wander around the narrow shop, you will see that no item is unintentionally placed on the sales floor. Near the storefront is a corner designated to display homewares such as Hasami Porcelain dishwares that are made in Japan and soap dishes with colorful patterns from India. Venturing towards the center of the store and you'll be greeted with rows of neatly arranged garments from the store's very own clothing line, FGS Originals, featuring elevated basics alongside exquisite pieces from renowned Japanese designers like Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto. The back of the store is a haven for military vintage enthusiasts as it's filled with aviator bags, military flight jackets, and souvenir jackets.\n\nEach item from Front General Store tells a meaningful story, making it a great destination for anyone who’s gift-hunting or searching for one-of-a-kind treasures.",

        "description": "When it comes to authentic Indian cuisine, Jackson Heights, Queens is often thought of by locals, and Angel is a must-visit destination for foodies looking to try flavorful, meat-free dishes from the Punjab region.\n\nThis family-owned restaurant is led by Chef Amrit Pal Singh, who previously worked at Adda in Long Island City and named the restaurant after his beloved daughter. Unlike Adda, Angel exudes an unassuming ambience, with sparsely decorated beige walls and functional yet simple furnitures.\n\nHowever, stepping inside and you will find yourself amongst a happy crowd of regulars indulging in their favorite dishes such as the heavenly Dahi Batata Puri—delightful wheat puffs brimming with a delicious blend of yogurt and potato, the Kale Pakora—crispy and flavorful chickpea fritters, the richly layered vegetable Dum Biryani, or the aromatic Lassuni Gobi, where garlic-infused cauliflower takes center stage.\n\nAngel's predominantly vegetarian menu serves as the foundation of their culinary offerings, showcasing a lesser-known approach to Indian cooking that is certain to captivate your senses and, perhaps, inspire a newfound appreciation for vegetarianism.",

        "description": "If you're up for an adventure to indulge in some funky and pungent Northern Vietnamese cuisine, look no further than Mắm NYC in Chinatown. Once a humble pop-up, it has now become a beloved permanent establishment on a corner of Forsyth street, all thanks to the immense popularity and support from its community and friends.\n\nThe main event is undoubtedly their bún đậu mắm tôm, which you probably can't find anywhere else in the city. On a bamboo tray adorned with banana leaves, the essence of bún đậu is captured in an assortment of flavors and textures including fried tofu, vermicelli, poached pork belly, blood sausage, crispy intestines, and sticky rice sausage. But what truly elevates the dish is the pièce de résistance – mắm tôm, a fermented shrimp paste with its intense aroma and deeply umami taste.\n\nThe restaurant operates exclusively open from Friday to Sunday, so plan your expedition accordingly and secure your reservation for an authentic street food adventure that will transport you back to the bustling alleys of Hanoi.",

The concise yet impressive menu offers a variety of delectable options, including the popular Lucknow Dum Biryania—a perfect fusion of goat and aromatic rice, expertly baked beneath a delicate layer of dough. Another must-try is the Dahi Batata Puri—crispy puffs that are loaded with layers of sweet, tangy, and spicy flavors.\n\nAt Adda, every dish promises an authentic, home-cooked journey through the diverse regions of India, leaving you with a profound appreciation for the rich tapestry of flavors and traditions.",
